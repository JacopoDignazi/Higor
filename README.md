Building Hierarchical structure out of mathematical definitions

Program allows to memorize mathematical formal definitions and automatically builds the hierarchical structure of a theory. 
In order to do so one can add a definition through bash interface, specifying the name of the object and its definition: 
other mathematical object in that definition must be uppercase and the program will recognize them and link with each other.
The program allows to save and load previous definitions; for an example go to load structure and load the textfile in this repository: 
inputs are d, s, 10217.txt
Final version of this project unfortunately lost to time. This version misses the "explore" functionality
